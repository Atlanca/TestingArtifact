text = '''
There shall be an `Answered` object which has the following
methods:
- `record(question, correct)`: records the answer to a
    question internally
- `get_hist(question)`: return `(num_right, num_wrong)`
    answers to a question

If the user requests a question that hasn't been asked,
the output shall be `(0, 0)`

Internally, the `Answered` object will have a `_hist` dict
which uses `question.question` as the keys and has
`(num_right, num_wrong)` as the values.
